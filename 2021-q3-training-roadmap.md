# 2021 Q3 Training Plan for Lando

## Important Data
 - Our first course with Lando, "Install Drupal 9 Locally with Lando," has been out for 30 days.

 - 12% of the people who start this course reach the end. Our average for other courses is 28%.

 - Feedback surveys and customers interviews report that:
    - People want more Drupal lessons using Lando. We should turn this into a full multi-lesson course.
    - The "Demo: Umami Food Magazine" installation profile does not put people at a good starting point to begin work because it's not a blank slate.
    - Installing Lando is a barrier for some people and may require its own lesson. _(Galadriel suspects this is responsible for the low completion rate.)_

 - Inbound analytics suggest interest in several additional topics utilizing Lando, including WordPress and Node development.
