# About this project
This is a training plan created for a team lead and four team members to execute on a training program for Lando. This is a fictional exercise and any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental.

It starts with lesson 1 which went live 30 days prior to the start of 2021-Q3.

In this lesson we learn the bare bones about what Lando is and how to use it to set up some locally running containers that are designed especially for Drupal. Once those are set up, we will install Drupal 9.

## Scope for Lesson 1:
 - Initialize a new project with Lando.
 - Install Drupal 9 locally
 - Tease additional lessons and related courses.

## Outside of scope for Lesson 1 (accounted for in the Q3 roadmap):
 - There is a link to install Lando and review requirements, however we do not give step-by-step instructions to install Lando.
    - That material already exists on the Lando website.
    - Accounting for every OS and local particularity could easily take too long for the scope of this project.
 - Expanding the Lando configuration with additional integrations or customization.
