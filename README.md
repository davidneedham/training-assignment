# About this project
This is an example training project for a team lead and four team members to execute a training program for [Lando](https://lando.dev/). This is a fictional exercise, and any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental.

It starts with lesson 1, which went live 30 days before the start of 2021-Q3.

In this lesson, we learn the bare bones about what Lando is and how to use it to set up some locally running containers that are designed especially for [Drupal](https://drupal.org) (an open-source content management system). With precisely the right containers at our disposal, we will install the latest and greatest: Drupal 9.

## Scope for Lesson 1:
 - Initialize a new project with Lando.
 - Install Drupal 9 locally
 - Tease additional lessons and related courses.

## Outside of scope for Lesson 1 (accounted for in the Q3 roadmap):
 - There is a link to install Lando and review requirements; however, we do not give step-by-step instructions to install Lando.
    - That material already exists on the Lando website.
    - Accounting for every OS and local particularity could easily take too long for this project's scope.
 - Expanding the Lando configuration with additional integrations or customization.
