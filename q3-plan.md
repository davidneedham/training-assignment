# 2021 Q3 Training Plan for Lando
> _About this document: This is a training plan created for a team lead and four team members to execute on a training program for Lando. This is a fictional exercise and any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental._

---

## Important Data
 - Our first course with Lando, "Install Drupal 9 Locally with Lando," has been out for 30 days.

 - 12% of the people who start this course complete it. Our average for other courses is 24%.

 - Feedback surveys and customers interviews report that:
    - People want more Lando+Drupal lessons. We should turn this into a full multi-lesson course.
    - The "Demo: Umami Food Magazine" installation profile does not put people at a good starting point to begin work.
    - Installing Lando is a barrier for some people and may require it's own lesson. _(Sam suspects this is responsible for the low completion rate.)_

 - Inbound analytics suggest interest in several additional topics utilizing Lando including WordPress and Node development.
