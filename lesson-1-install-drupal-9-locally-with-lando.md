Most new development projects begin on your computer. If you're comfortable in a terminal window, [Lando](https://lando.dev/) is a tool that makes it fast and for you and your colleagues to spin up customized environments. Configuration is saved and distributed with the code for your project, so each person's environments are consistent.

## Lesson 1

In this lesson, you'll learn how to use Lando to get Drupal 9 up and running on your computer in 12-minutes or less.

1. Install Lando.
    
    Lando runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can find instructions and system requirements at [https://docs.lando.dev/basics/installation.html](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/installation.html). 
    
    > _Note: Lando will automatically install Docker if you do not already have it. **If you already have Docker installed, this may break your existing configuration.**_
 
 2. Open your terminal and verify that Lando installed successfully: 
    
    `lando version`

 3. Create a new folder for this project and navigate into it:

    `mkdir drupal9 && cd drupal9`

4. Lando has a helpful multistep interface for initializing a new project based on predefined recipes. We're going to streamline the process by providing all of the details in a single command. 

    Copy this entire block and run it in your terminal:
    
```
lando init \
--source remote \
--remote-url https://www.drupal.org/download-latest/tar.gz \
--remote-options="--strip-components 1" \
--recipe drupal9 \
--webroot . \
--name drupal9
```

This command will download and extract your Drupal codebase and create a `lando.yml` file for saving the configuration for this project. We don't need this right now, but you'll need it for the next lesson.

> _Note: if you already have code from an existing codebase, you may want to step through the initialization yourself with `lando init`._

5. Start the Lando containers and spin up your new environment with `lando start`.

    This step could take a minute while Lando interfaces with Docker to spin up and configure the containers for you.

    > _Fun fact: if you clone a project locally and discover a lando.yml file, you can skip the initialization and simply `lando start`. This generates an identical environment to everyone else on the project!_

6. Open the website in your browser. If you followed these steps exactly, it should be [https://drupal9.lndo.site/](https://drupal9.lndo.site/).

    Chrome will warn you that "Your connection is not private," but we expect that. We will fix this in a later lesson. 
    
    For now, let's proceed forward:

    1. Click the __Advanced__ button.
    2. Click the __Proceed to drupal9.lndo.site (unsafe)__ link.

7. All that's left is installing Drupal!
    1. Click the __Save and continue__ button.
    
    2. Choose the installation profile you want for this project. We're going to use __Demo: Umami Food Magazine (Experimental)__ to give us a prebuilt example with which to work.

    3. Click the __Save and continue__ button.
 
    4. Enter Lando's default database values for this recipe:
        1. __Database name:__ `drupal9`
        2. __Database username:__ `drupal9`
        3. __Database password:__ `drupal9`
        4. Expand the __Advanced Options__
        5. __Host:__ `database`
    
    5. Click the __Save and continue__ button.

    6. Enter a __Site email address__, __Username__, and __Password__ that you will remember.

    7. Uncheck the box __Receive email notifications__.

    8. Click the __Save and continue__ button.
